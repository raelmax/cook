## Using
```
$ cook raelmax/cook-basic-template
```

This command will ask you some questions about this template and generate your
project based on your answers.

## Templates
Cook use the same syntax of cookiecutter to your projects templates, so, you can
use any templates from [cookiecutter list](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter#available-cookiecutters).

## Create your own template
You can(and should!) create your owns templates, and to help you with this task
we offer a example [at this repository](https://github.com/raelmax/cook-basic-template).
